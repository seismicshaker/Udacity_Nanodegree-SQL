## Project 1: Deforestation Exploration
### Introduction to SQL
In this project, I complete a Report for ForestQuery into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016. I use SQL queries to explore the given forestation dataset.

## Project 2: Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator

In this project, I assess and fix issues with the fictional social news aggregator, Udiddit.
